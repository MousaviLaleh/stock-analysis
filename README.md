# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
Steve wnats to research about Green Energy stocks and finds out which company has the best performance, to invest in, specifically DAQO New Energy Corp, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels.<br/>
I will using VBA ( Visual Basic for Appllication ) throughout this project, to automate tasks and reus codes for any stock. VBA reduces the chance of accidents and errors and increases the code running time.<br/>


### Purpose
The purpose is improving the logic of the VBA code in order to make it more efficient to works well for thousands of stocks. At the click of a button, Steve can analyze an entire dataset.

## Analysis and Challenges
Steve wants to to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market. I have prepared an Excel file containing the stock data over the last few years. 


## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary
address the following questions:
  What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
